# Game Jam Simulator

# Description

You are a game developer, and your task for this evening is to finish a game jam. Sounds easy? And easy it is. If not for the fact that you have a serious coffee addiction, your work habits are absolutely awful, and worst of all - the temperature in your room never seems to be just right. It's always either too hot or too cold. 

Can you manage to finish the game, or are your distractions just too much to manage?

# Controls

Just use your mouse to click on things. Keyboard is used to complete minigames.
